Codes for the neural MVN decoding algorithm in "Multi Variable-layer Neural Networks for Decoding Linear Codes":

The codes are written in tensor-flow version '1.15.2'. There are four folders corresponding for the four codes considered in the paper. Each folder contains:
- G and H matrices of a code, 
- a python code for training a network
The "Multi Variable-layer Neural Networks for Decoding Linear Codes" paper is published in IWCIT,IEEE,2020 and available here: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9163473/
